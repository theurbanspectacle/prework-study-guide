            <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property  color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with a block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>In order to link STYLECSS with HTML we need to add code after the meta element to connect both pages. "link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" with angle brackets.</li>
